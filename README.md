## 🧠 Objective

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build strong core **JavaScript & Node.js** fundamentals tailored for automation testing.
- Understand **Playwright** concepts, selectors, and API interactions.
- Prepare a reusable base of knowledge for **E2E Testing**, **API Testing**, and **Framework Design**.
